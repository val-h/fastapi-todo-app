This is a basic API for a todo application made with FastAPI. You can use any frontend framework with this. I am using SQLite in this project. Other databases can also be used easily. <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/">Refer to this</a> for more information on how to use other databases with FastAPI.

## Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Gubra-A-S/fastapi-todo-app.git
```

## Run locally

Running locally requires python3 and pip

### Install dependencies

```

source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start server

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Track changes is enabled, so the server is automatically restarted whenever the code is updated.

## Run with docker

### Run server

## API endpoints:

- Get all the todo items present in the database, send a get request on the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/todos
```

- To post a todo item in the database, send a post request on the following endpoint:

- To update a specific todo item as completed/pending, send a put request on the following endpoint:

```

```

For further details, you can refer to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a> after starting the server. It will give you an auto generated and very detailed documentation.
